Hi!, My name is Jacob I'm a software Engineer since many years ago, I'm writing this blog just to keep a record of things I've learned through the time, I hope it can be helpful for anyone.

I have a background working in projects as lead, database migrations, implementing technical standards; I consider myself able to work on high pressure and fast paced environments with excellent problem solving.

The main areas where I have oriented my career are Software Development, Linux System Administrator, Database Administrator, Software Architecture all of this with medium projects; I have been fortunate to work in financial areas in different places maintaining or integrating Payments Service Providers or developing financial modules for Bank Systems.

Over time I have worked with cloud services such as AWS, GCP, and their respective products(EC2, ECS, Serverless, etc.); I love Golang, Python and of course Django Web Framework; You can check more about me in my LinkedIn profile.

And last but not least, at the time I'm starting this blog I'm learning and improving my English skills, currently I'm in B1.5 level so please don't be rude if a made mistakes.
