I have a background working in projects as lead, database migrations, implementing technical standards; I consider myself able to work on high pressure and fast paced environments with excellent problem solving.
The main areas where I have oriented my career are Software Development, Linux System Administrator, Database Administrator, Software Architecture with medium projects; I have been fortunate to work in financial areas in different places maintaining or integrating Payments Service Providers or developing financial modules for Bank Systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
